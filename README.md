This project is a sentiment analysis classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict positive and negative sentiment in Amazon product reviews.

The text data was preprocessed by removing noise, performing lemmatization, and extracting TF-IDF features using Scikit-learn.

The program trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models (Perceptron, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes), while optimizing for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Pandas, NLTK, and Scikit-learn packages are used.
